214-Cheatsheet
==============

Let's work together on this. Send pull requests with updates! 
Just submit text files with random things you'd like to add.

If you're unfamiliar with how pull requests work but have some basic experience 
with git, let me know, and I'll add you as a collaborator.

We've got a doc file with some information right now. 
I'll handle formatting. Write things that are important.
